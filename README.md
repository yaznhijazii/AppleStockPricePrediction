## Data
The project utilizes historical stock price data of Apple Inc. (AAPL) obtained from [source]. The dataset includes features such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

## Methodology
The project employs the following methodologies:
- Data preprocessing including checking for missing values and converting date columns to datetime objects.
- Time series analysis including stationarity tests (ADF test), differencing, and visualization of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions.
- ARIMA modeling using grid search to find the best parameters and fitting the ARIMA model to the data.
- LSTM modeling for stock price forecasting, including data scaling, model architecture definition, training, and evaluation.
- Ensemble approach to combine forecasts from ARIMA and LSTM models.
- Visualization of forecasted stock prices.

## Usage
To use this project:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apple-stock-price-forecasting.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Apple_Stock_Price.ipynb` to replicate the analysis and forecasting.

## Results
The project achieves the following results:
- Evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE) for individual ARIMA and LSTM models.
- Forecasted stock prices visualized alongside actual historical prices.
- Evaluation of the ensemble approach on the validation set.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- tensorflow
